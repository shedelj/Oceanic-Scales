Oceanic-Scales
==============

Welcome the official Oceanic Scales DANM250A Github casino and spa. We have a top-notch menagerie of trained staff standing by to serve you whatever your heart may desire, however and whenever you want it.  This is of course assuming that "whatever" is source code, "however" is how we wrote it and "whenever" is immediately.  If you didn't want it immediately, you're probably out of luck because this is the internet and we're not even sure how we'd go about delayed gratification.

The folder "Processing" is full of a bunch of simulations of the system that we built as part of play testing
The "Web" folder is the old web frontend that we never ended up building
"misc" is a bunch of miscellaneous code and files that could be useful later, like reading serial with python and whatnot.

"production" is where things really get cooking.  See the readme in the directory for more information.
